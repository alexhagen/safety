# safety
stay safe when out in the world

Safety - probably to be renamed - is an app that will detect dangerous events,
such as a yell, a fall, or a crash and immediately turn on all your phone's
faculties to help authorities find, help, save, or solve what happened. I'll
be selling this on the app store for a reasonable price, but I'm open sourcing
it because I think it's important and I can't fathom making it unavailable to
someone who needed it.
